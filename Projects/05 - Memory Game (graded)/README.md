## Instructions
The purpose of the game is to match all 16 cards with the least number of moves while keeping the number of stars as close as possible to 3, and compliting the game in the shortest time possible.

To play, click on any of the "face down" cards, oncover its symbol, and try to find the other card hiding the same symbol.
If you pick the wrong card, both of them will flip back over; if, instead, you find the match, the cards will be reveaed for the rest of the game.

The game ends when all the cards have been matched.

The star rating will drecrease from 3 to 0 as you increase the number of moves (2 cards flipped equals one move).
